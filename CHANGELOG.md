All notable changes to this project are documented here.
This project uses [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).

## [1.0.2] - 2026-08-17

Ships the per-profile device inquiries in the packaged release.

### Added

- **Per-profile device inquiry.** A profile's saved IMEIs can be checked against
  HAMTA, customs, or both from the profile's own *استعلامات* tab; results, status
  and errors are stored on the profile (`POST /profile-device-inquiry`, executed
  by `profile_inquiry.py` as a tracked subprocess).
- **Read-only profile overview.** Selecting a profile shows its data without
  editable inputs; editing is an explicit action.

### Fixed

- **`profile_inquiry.py` was missing from the bundle.** `panel.py` spawns it for
  every inquiry, but it was absent from the packaged file list, so the inquiry
  button would have failed on a user's machine. It now ships, and the verifier
  parses `panel.py` for every script it spawns and fails when any of them is not
  in the bundle — the same class of bug as the v1.0.1 hamta solver, now caught
  structurally rather than by name.
- Inquiry robots honour `IRICA_ESTELAM_STORE`, so a per-profile run uses its own
  temporary store instead of the shared `estelam_store.json`.

## [1.0.1] - 2026-08-17

Fixes the hamta inquiry captcha in the packaged release.

### Fixed

- **Hamta inquiry captcha was broken in the v1.0.0 bundle.** `estelam_hamta.py`
  reads the modal captcha through its own solver package (`Hamta-solver/`), which
  is separate from the gomrok one and was still torch-only; the v1.0.0 bundle
  shipped neither that package nor PyTorch, so the hamta robot raised
  `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'live_solve'` the moment it reached the
  captcha. The hamta CRNN is now exported to ONNX (55.0 MB `.pt` → 18.3 MB
  `.onnx`) and the bundle carries a torch-free backend for it.

### Added

- `Hamta-solver/onnx_solve.py` — `OnnxHamtaSolver`, an onnxruntime backend with
  the same surface as `HamtaSolver` (`read_pil` / `read_bgr` / `read_file`) and
  numpy ports of the CTC greedy decode and confidence signals.
- `Hamta-solver/live_solve.load_solver()` now selects a backend: torch when
  importable (development, unchanged), otherwise ONNX.
- `lab/scripts/export_hamta_onnx.py` — exports the hamta checkpoint and refuses
  to leave an artifact behind unless both engines return identical result dicts
  (number, text, confidence and snap distance) on every validation sample.
- Bundle build and verifier now ship and check the hamta solver, and the smoke
  test resolves it through `estelam_hamta.load_solver()` rather than the class,
  so a broken `sys.path` cannot reach a user.

### Changed

- `Hamta-solver/utils.py` and `live_solve.py` import torch lazily, so the modules
  stay importable in a torch-free runtime (`number_decode` only needs the
  pure-python edit distance from `utils`).

## [1.0.0] - 2026-08-17

First packaged Windows x64 release.

### Added

- **Per-profile browser visibility.** Browsers launch headed but parked
  off-screen, so several robots can run without cluttering the desktop and
  without the throttling a truly headless session would suffer. Each running
  profile gets a live show/hide button in the panel (`POST /browser-visibility`,
  Win32 `SetWindowPos`, independent of the Selenium session).
- **Paste button beside every profile input**, normalizing Persian/Arabic digits,
  stripping direction marks, with a select-and-hint fallback when the browser
  denies clipboard access.
- **Already-registered detection.** If the pre-payment invoice page appears right
  after the IMEI step, the profile has already been through the flow: the robot
  captures the invoice, saves the payment link, records the profile as *success*
  (with link and screenshot), reports to the panel log and Telegram, and stops
  instead of burning captcha attempts on a pointless retry.
- **Active-tab highlighting** across every tab strip (main navigation, log
  sub-tabs, profile form tabs, and the inquiry service picker): brand gradient
  fill, white label, and an underline, so the current tab is unambiguous.
- **ONNX captcha solver path.** The CRNN solver can run on `onnxruntime`, which is
  what the packaged release ships; PyTorch is no longer required at runtime.

### Changed

- **Durable profile store.** `profiles.json` is now written atomically
  (temp file + `fsync` + `os.replace`) with a `.bak` of the last good copy and an
  in-process cache. A corrupt or partially written file is never overwritten with
  an empty store, so profiles can no longer vanish under load.
- **imeiStep latency.** A one-shot page probe replaces the fixed captcha wait: a
  healthy page is confirmed in roughly a tenth of a second, and a page that
  loaded without a captcha is detected and refreshed almost immediately instead
  of after a ten-second wait.
- **Bounded Telegram delivery.** Every send carries a hard deadline. On timeout
  the robot logs that the screenshot was kept locally and continues to the next
  step, rather than stalling at the pre-payment stage when Telegram is
  unreachable.
- **Submit is always on.** The auto-submit toggle is gone from the UI; disabling
  it is a debugging-only CLI flag (`--no-submit`).

### Fixed

- `--brand2` was undefined in the inquiry page theme, which made the active
  button's gradient invalid and render blank.
- The log view hard-coded the active class on the profile sub-tab regardless of
  the selected mode.
- A blocked `execute_script` is bounded by the page-load timeout, not the script
  timeout; the page probe now clamps both, so a healthy page is never refreshed
  by mistake.
